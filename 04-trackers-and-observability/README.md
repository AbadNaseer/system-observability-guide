## üìç What is a Tracker?

In DevOps & Observability, a **tracker** is any component or tool that is used to:

> **Observe**, **record**, or **follow specific events or behaviors** within a system, user flow, service, or infrastructure.

It's like a ‚Äúflight recorder‚Äù that helps answer:
- What happened?
- Where did it happen?
- Who did it?
- How often?

## üß† Real Example: Error Tracker in Action (Node.js + Sentry)

```js
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'https://your-sentry-dsn',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

app.get('/crash', function mainHandler(req, res) {
  throw new Error("Order processing failed"); // Sentry auto-tracks this
});
